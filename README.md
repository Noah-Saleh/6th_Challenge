# 6th_Challenge - San Francisco Housing

## Summary of Purpose  

This is not a program. 
This is just a graphical/numerical analysis of potential properties to invest in.
Through this analysis, I ultimately recommended 2 properties based off their price per sqft & off their gross rent records.

## Required/Compatible Technologies

**Compatible OS's:** Mac, Windows, or Linux  
**Programming language:** Python inside of Jupyter Lab  
**Required libraries:** pandas as pd, hvplot.pandas, Path from pathlib

Using a conda environment from anaconda is preferable.

To view it, just open it up in GitHub. If you can't see the hvplots, you should download the repository & open it with Jupyter Lab or some program that can run .ipynb files (e.g. VS Code using some extensions/add-ons). The cells should have already been run. If some haven't been run, then restart the kernel and run all the cells.
